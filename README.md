# Summer Fun with Operating Systems and Systems Programming

This repository is made available for students wanting to get a head start on their studies for the Fall 2021.
The first three labs of DAT320 is available here.
You can navigate to the different folders and click on the various Markdown files (`.md` files) and read their content.
Some of them end with `_questions.md`.
These are assignment questions that you can try to answer.

Our QuickFeed tool will not available for running tests on these assignments.
Further, we will create the 2021 version of the course quite yet, so it won't be possible to sign up and use the `dat320-2021` course on GitHub.
For material that makes reference to `dat320-2020`, please ignore those parts.
As such, you may not be able to use all the material, but much of it should be possible to use.

## Recommended Tasks

- Lab1: Familiarize yourself and get used to working with the Unix/Linux command line.
- Lab1: Watch the Missing Semester videos.
  Do the associated exercises.
  We recommend watching all videos, but not all are required for the course.
- Lab1: Sign up for Unix account.
- Lab1: Practice your Git and GitHub skills. You can play with your own repositories.
- Lab1: Remote Login with SSH.
- Lab2: C Programming Tutorial (this is cursory; mainly used in the course to understand C code examples from the book)
- Lab3: Go Programming.
  This is the main programming language in this course and is therefore strongly recommended that you learn as much as you can before the semester.
  We recommend exploring the provided resources and possibly other resources as well to hone your Go programming skills.
