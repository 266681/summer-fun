# Summer Fun with Operating Systems and Systems Programming

This repository is made available for students to get started with DAT320 for the Fall 2022 (`dat320-2022`).
The first three labs of DAT320 are available here. The students will be able to to submit their lab work as soon as the QuickFeed system for `dat320-2022` course is up and running.  
You can navigate to the different folders and click on the various Markdown files (`.md` files) and read their content.
Some of them end with `_questions.md`.
These are assignment questions that you can try to answer.

*For material that makes reference to `dat320-202x`, please ignore those parts.*

## Recommended Tasks

- Lab1: Familiarize yourself and get used to working with the Unix/Linux command line.
- Lab1: Watch the Missing Semester videos.
  Do the associated exercises.
  We recommend watching all videos, but not all are required for the course.
- Lab1: Sign up for Unix account.
- Lab1: Practice your Git and GitHub skills. You can play with your own repositories.
- Lab1: Remote Login with SSH.
- Lab2: C Programming Tutorial
- Lab3: Go Programming.
  This is the main programming language in this course and is therefore strongly recommended that you learn as much as you can before the semester.
  We recommend exploring the provided resources and possibly other resources as well to hone your Go programming skills.

### Syllabus

The course syllabus is based on this [textbook](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/):
Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces. Version 1.00.
Remzi H. Arpaci-Dusseau and Andrea C. Arpaci-Dusseau

### Recommended Go Books

I've not read this book myself, but I've heard good things about it for beginners:

- [Get Programming with Go](https://www.manning.com/books/get-programming-with-go)

For those of you with prior experience with programming, I recommend:

- [The Go Programming Language](https://www.gopl.io).

## Questions

Please ask students that already took the course or a student mentor.
